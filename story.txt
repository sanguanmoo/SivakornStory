Once upon a time, there was a student named Win studying at UW-Madison. During his sophomore year, he was suffered with the semester due to workload and too many midterms.
All of a sudden midterms decided to become friendly to Win one day. Even though they once haunted his dreams, he now knew them as truly good pieces of paper.
When the next set of midterms came, Win used his newfound confidence to rapidly prepare.
However, midterms betrayed win by calling one fo their big brothers "30% of your final grade MIDTERM". Win prepared hard for this unexpected event. The night of meeting the midterm, he clinged to his pillow trying to squeeze the most amount of aleep before he wakes up and relizes that midterm is upon him.
Then Win used his ultimate to defeat all midterms by calling Einsteinte do all midterms for me. However, this ultimate can only be used once in my life, so I was still suffered with next midterms. Finally, Win died peacefully from those exams...
